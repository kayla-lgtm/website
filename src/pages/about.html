As the Founder and CEO of Second Foundation AI, he leads the company's vision to transform AI from a collection of disconnected tools into a true intelligence layer-one that unifies data, modernizes workflows, and empowers leaders to run clearer, faster, and more resilient operations.

Brett's career spans global AI sales leadership, enterprise consulting, and large-scale go-to-market execution. Before launching Second Foundation AI, he served as Strategy Lead for Fujitsu's Data and AI Division, where he built the AI GTM plan for Retail+ and led US commercialization for Human Motion Analytics. Prior to that, he was Global VP of AI Sales at F33.AI, where he surpassed revenue goals by 250% and built strategic alliances with AWS and Google that accelerated adoption across retail and manufacturing.

Today, Brett brings that same blend of strategic clarity, commercial discipline, and technical fluency to Second Foundation AI. He works directly with business and government leaders to design AI-driven operating models, integrate intelligent systems, and build long-term partnerships that unlock measurable impact.">

                            data-bio="Rohit Kapoor is a technology entrepreneur, AI researcher, and enterprise architect with 23+ years of experience building AI-driven software products and global technology businesses. Long before the emergence of generative AI and ChatGPT, Rohit was actively researching, publishing, and deploying artificial intelligence for real-world business systems, making him a true pre-LLM AI practitioner.

Rohit holds a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering from the University of Alberta, where he graduated top of his class (GPA 9.0/9.0). His early career included formal AI research and hands-on work in Artificial Intelligence as early as 1998, including an AI internship at CDAC, well before AI became mainstream.

Over two decades ago, Rohit began applying AI to business and enterprise use cases, designing and building business AI systems, intelligent automation, and early AI bots using pre-LLM technologies such as rule-based systems, statistical models, expert systems, and platforms like IBM Watson. His work focused on making AI practical, reliable, and commercially viable inside large enterprises; a philosophy that continues to define his approach today.

Rohit previously spent over five years at IBM, where he became the youngest Master Inventor in the WebSphere software group, led core architecture initiatives, and accumulated 48+ patents and multiple published papers across AI and software engineering. He later led enterprise architecture and platform strategy roles at Red Hat, helping large banks and Fortune-class enterprises adopt mission-critical technologies at scale.

Currently, Rohit is the &quot;Chief Technical Meditator&quot; aka CTO at Tekmonks, where he leads innovation across enterprise AI platforms, cybersecurity, distributed systems, and sovereign AI solutions. His work spans building modern AI systems while deeply understanding their historical foundations from symbolic AI and expert systems to today's large-scale, agentic and generative architectures.

Rohit combines deep technical credibility, AI research roots, and strong business acumen, further strengthened by an MBA from Chicago Booth, enabling him to bridge advanced AI with real business outcomes, responsibly, securely, and at scale.">
